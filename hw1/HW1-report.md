- IN: {E, F, M}  
  Nodes that feed into the SCC but are not reachable from it.  
- OUT: {H, L}  
  Nodes reachable from the SCC but that do not link back.  
- Tendrils: {J, N, O}  
  Pages dangling off the structure, not connected directly to the SCC.  
- Tubes: None.  
- Disconnected: {K, I}  
  Nodes that do not connect to the SCC at all.
